The Jobs To Be Done

Between Tesla, Ford, Chevrolet, and the rest of the auto manufacturers it’s understood that in 2021 self driving autonomous vehicles are the future of transportation.

For whatever rhyme or reason you may or may not disagree with autonomous vehicles being the main stream mode of transportation We all know that it’s coming whether we like it or not. Companies like Ford are invested in the platform because they feel there’s an enormous amount of money to be made. Imagine if you employed vehicles instead of people that are driven by software to provide delivery services something as simple as grocery delivery to every day customers.we all know that it’s coming whether we like it or not. Companies like Ford are invested in the platform because they feel there’s an enormous amount of money to be made. Imagine if you employed vehicles instead of people that are driven by software to provide delivery services something as simple as grocery delivery to every day customers.We already know the companies like Facebook and Amazon are invested in autonomous delivery services for their same-day delivery. Since COVID-19 we know that people have been adopting at home grocery delivery and of course since Amazon is two day delivery service we are an instant gratification economy. So, the big question remains what does it mean for autonomous vehicles to provide self delivery services to every day customers in our near future?

So I was driving down the road today and it occurred to me that autonomous vehicles have to deal with things like EMS emergency management services where a firetruck or a police officer might flip on their lights and then your vehicle has to stop in an instant.So I was driving on the road today and it occurred to me that autonomous vehicles have to deal with things like EMS emergency management services where a fire truck or a police officer might flip on their lights and then your vehicle has to stop in an instant.In that regard there’s also things like from school zones where you have to slow down to 15 mph. My biggest question for an autonomous vehicle is can you read the sign that says 15 mph? And does it know that school might be canceled? Does this vehicle respect the person it is in the middle of the road a.k.a. the crossing guard when it comes to their 

There autonomous delivery service. No you might be thinking why does this matter at all to my grocery delivery from target being made by a Ford vehicle but it has everything to do with my grocery delivery from a Ford vehicle from target when my vehicle is going through a school zone.

Not only does it have to do with school zones but it has to do with wild animals question so lots of questions remain when it comes to home delivery services and autonomous vehicles:

Here are a few:

What happens if the vehicle is in a wreck?What happens if the vehicle is in a wreck?What happens if the vehicle slows down due to traffic? What happens if the vehicle comes upon a construction zone?

And then not only what happens to the vehicle but what does the user who is ordering their groceries see on their screen when it comes to this delivery?

Let’s look no further than dominoes.

I would say in the past 10 years Domino’s has been known as the future of pizza delivery. If there is a way to order pizza Domino’s has adopted it. One of the most important things about Domino’s delivery is there transparency. It’s why am OK with paying an extra two dollars for my large cheese pizza then anywhere else. 

Dominoes goes so far as to tell me the intricate details as to when my pizza is been made and approximately where are my driver is at any given time.

they let me know if there’s a substitution to my order or if they can’t fulfill my order almost immediately with a text message.

Domino’s has figured out the whole of the user experience of delivering pizza. No matter where I started from if I’ve used Siri or Google to order a pizza Domino’s has it figured out and the end result is that they make sure that I am going to get my hot fresh pizza within 30 minutes or less which is their customer and brand priority.

So what does that mean for Ford and autonomous delivery?

Autonomous delivery has to have the same kind of transparency in order for customers to actually trust it. What makes me trust autonomous delivery over door dash or any other delivery service that I could have? In fact what makes me trust autonomous delivery over just going outside and getting something myself? Well it’s the same kind of transparency that I would have if I were to call someone over the phone and I would say hey something is wrong with my order can you fix it?
