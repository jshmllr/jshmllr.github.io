I didn’t go to art school to be a designer and that’s ok.

The unconventional exeprience I’ve developed while working in customer service provides me with a set of soft skills out of the norm. From interacting with key stakeholders to presenting design feedback, getting over one’s ego is essential. That being said, my non-design work experience isn't something to be glossed over.

When I worked for Apple I used to diagnose problems or find solutions for customers. Not enough listening is done in today’s world with enough people ready and willing to speak. It also established a rapport and boundaries with customers. This skill is more than just not being an asshole; but, rather it’s one that gets everyone on board with an idea early and often.

Communication at its best is the synthesized way of explaining an idea with brevity to another. Knowing your audience isn’t just something for a product but with regard to an team endeavor. When it comes to design handoff, I like to ensure that my t’s and i’s are crossed and dotted. How important would it be in today’s world if we took a little more time to listen and had more patience? What if ideas were democratically discussed and voted on versus beligerant verbiage?

Measuring success for a design is knowing that it solves the problem but even with the highest fidelity of something you can never be too sure that someone else grasps the intent and decision making behind an idea.

So, how is your organization doing with soft skills? How are your designs presented?
