## Gannett

During my time with Gannett (the USA TODAY Network), I've worked on numerous projects with the Storytelling Studio. Most notably, I worked with the Storytelling Studio (formerly Gannett's Innovation Lab) on redesigning and relaunching longform content with a a few twists. The first being that we wanted to support more storyforms that longform including short-form, support photojournalism, list making, and varying story archs all while giving out. So, instead we created a framework that enhcna (in the form of building new features, such as password-protected shared links) and marketing efforts. Additionally, I helped lead the engineering efforts to build the marketing pages for Dropbox Pro.

After the initial launch of the new framework, our team was bent on growth through reciruclation and looking at funnel acquisition methods. We spent months experimenting with marketing efforts, newsletter tactics, and testing to fine the reader experience. We saw a direct and substantial positive impact on subscriptions and engagements through our improvements.

Our small “blue sky” growth team to explores how we might foster increased adoption of things like social sharing, reader commenting, newsletter subscriptions, and more. The most successful project to emerge was the addition of our In-Depth Index. Facilitated through the knowledge gained from user testing and research, we increased awareness of internal kpis, raised the bar for visual production, just as we had hoped, and unlocked possibilities for other sister teams to build richer, more reader-centric experiences.

In my final year at the company, I joined the Web Infrastructure team as a Design Engineer to work on Design Systems. I had spent all my tenure at Dropbox maintaining a suite of design tools, so was able to provide historical knowledge and engineering principles to address inconsistencies in both the design and implementation of many product surfaces. The result of my work was Scooter, an open-source (S)CSS framework and design system adopted by several product teams to speed up their work.
