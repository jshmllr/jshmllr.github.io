This might be an oversimplificiation, but sometimes you find yourself starring into the void at a white screen, blank notebook page, or empty whiteboard. You know all of the frameworks. You could jump to the Interaction Design Foundation, IDEO, or any number of publications; but, the answers just aren’t coming. Sometimes getting started can be half the battle to leading a new project; so, here is a simple recipe to get your mind jogging when it comes to how we might approach a problem with design thinking.

## How might we?
Yes, how might we? This isn’t an easy question always but pair this with your Jobs to Be Done.

## Finish this with this segment:
- Knows our users
- Anticipates our users
- Makes our users lives simpler
- Looks our for our users
- Rewards our users

If you fill out the answers to those questions you’re well on your way to successful design deliverables with actionable answers

You’ll now have the opportunity to answer five whys, how, when, why, where, what, and architect the simplest conceptual moddel you may when it comes to the abstraction of your question to be answered.
