## Transitioning the In-Depth Editor
The most popular page next to the new page is our In-Depth Editor where producers and staff spend a majority of their time.

- **Timeline**:
- **Goals**:
- **Team**:
- **Role**:
- **Area of Focus**:   

--
In its current state it contains a few key areas for manipulation a configuration. 
<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/screenshot.jpg"
    title="Storytelling Studio"
    alt="An application screenshot"
  />
</div>
- Global navigation
- Left-Sidebar including:
	- Configuration Text Editor
	- Asset tray and uploads
- Central Canvas
- Contextual Toolbar

In order to achieve a cohesive system of designing we can look to several of our UX Laws friends.

Here is the goal:


### Barrier to entry 
Upon first look, the configuration code seems daunting to staff members. The current model they're coming from is Presto's WYSIWIG editor. 

Presto contains sidebars, a toolbar, and an all around

## Moving the interface forward and introducing story optimization features is a process

With the most recent push of updating the global navigation we realized that the ability to create a new configuration from the interface was lost. The one button was broken apart into two unique buttons and placed in the toolbar.

## Making room
The toolbar currently provides primary and secondary actions including
- refresh *the preview*
- open in... preview, published, and Presto 
- enable device mode
- and a more ... settings section containing subscriber simulations and api changes

By combining the three open buttons into one split button, we'll  immediately see more screen real estate.
