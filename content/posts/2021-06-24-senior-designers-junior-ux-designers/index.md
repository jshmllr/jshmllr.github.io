A new designer can graduate to seniority in a few things
The definition of senior can vary between organizations.
When we define what senior means in relation to a pay scale and an organizations ladder, in relation to responsibility/ownership and in relation to care of their work.

## Asking the right questions

>> It's not necessarily about what you bring to the table. It's about the right kinds of questions you're asking and your involvement.


At a small startup you could be the sole one responsible for all the things. You're the design director at your small design shop of four or five. We know that senior means different things in different organizations. 
Leadership, responsibility, or area of ownership but another definition is expertise in the field. You've obtained the knowledge to design X. The likelihood that you've shipped things and an implied autonomy, history, and pedigree of having shipped things already without much guidance. Regarding product specific, thorough understanding of the product, its needs, and its user needs.


## Observation is one method when it comes to filling the gap to senior.
Observation is one method and asking the right questions. There might even be an opportunity with a new initiative if you're in a larger organization to test out the waters. During this time you might think some things make sense but perhaps don't know it at the time. Understanding what constraints you're working with can also be helpful. 
Also, don't wait to be invited to meetings and the conversations. Show the initiative to be present and inquisitive to gain the exposure. If may be in this time that you never know when someone may respectfully call upon your opinion and expertise.


## Play the perceived part and fake it until you make it.
Stay humble, ask lots of questions at the right time and document the process. Lean into the unknown embracing ambiguity. Your fear is conquered with your process as you also stand on the shoulders of giants.
