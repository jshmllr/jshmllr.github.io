## Coming to the same enterprise with new ideas

...

What is the Medici Effect?

## Introducing sacrificial concepts

Bring people together with different experiences and backgrounds to create an explosion of ideas.

## Imagining the most amazing invention doesn‚Äôt qualify one as an innovative person, you need to be able to sell it to the world.


## Create new ideas through exposing to a range of cultures, teach yourself many different things, reverse your assumptions, and take on multiple perspectives of a specific situation.

Reversing assumptions...

## Quantity of ideas increases the quality of ideas.

## Prepare for innovation by relaxing, making mistakes, and removing stressors or obstacles.

## People and firms with processes in place kill off attempts to break out of it. Any ideas that don‚Äôt correspond to the values of the network will get eliminated. Leave the network to have the highest chance of success.
