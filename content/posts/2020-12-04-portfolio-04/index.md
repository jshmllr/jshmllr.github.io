excerpt: On failure and the framework that once was.

The goals were simple we wanted to give newsroom designers and producers a tool that they could use to create a new storytelling experience. If you could think about the interaction it was just a slideshow type experience but we wanted something more that we could anchor to the USA Today brand and network as a whole.

We also one of the ability to work with the social team making a more streamlined workflow between photojournalist and the social teams. Right now this consists of two separate workflows where information synthesis and sharing isn't as conducive and streamlined as it could've been.

We also knew that based on former data readers enjoyed short form contact that they can absorb. This was in the time and Instagram launched stories and Snapchat was beginning its heyday. 


this tool will be built outside of the current authoring platform
this tool will leverage the Universal Web framework on the display side
this tool is designed to be used with or without a designer
this tool is an MVP that will be iterated on over time

We had user testing
We tracked iterations and prepared the MVP for progressive enhancement

Eventually AMP Stories became adopted by the content and editorial teams https://www.ampproject.org/docs/design/visual_story

But, this wasn't a complete failure; because now we have an opportunity to create stories much like this one on [exposure.so](https://www.distastefulshroom.com/furloughed) but with our In-Depth framework.
