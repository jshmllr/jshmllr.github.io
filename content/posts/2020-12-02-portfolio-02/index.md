## Determining the value of additional content

The latest is the ability to hide certain features of a story behind a paywall. We're calling this Extras . We believe in the continued elevation of our network reporting by conveying the value of the information included all while maintaining and improving on our immersive storytelling experiences. While the premise is not without it's concerns‚Äîmainly being how academia hides their valuable articles behind a paywall that benefit society at large‚Äîwe feel that we can provide a seamless experience in an existing and relative model for our recurring audience to engage with.

## Questions, Assumptions, and Potential Pitfalls

The first question to address is what does it mean to provide an enhanced experience?
Then do our readers even find it valuable?
If yes, how might we convey the value of enhanced stories? Then, how might we test this efficiently and effectively?

At the time, we have three existing subscription models and payment scales: Free, Metered, and Subscriber Only. We consider our most valuable reporting to reside in the exclusive content surrounding hot button topics, interviews, and investigations. This content typically requires a greater amount of time to create and thus provides deeper meaning to said topics for our audience. One example might be the Poisoned Cities series which took reporting staff two years to accumulate photos, knowledge, and interviews to then write the extensive four-part series.
In light of this, we'll define an enhanced experience as any story that includes features which help the reader go deeper.
Potential pitfalls of this model are that we'll give away too much information to the reader devaluing the extra content eventually leading to them not wanting the extra features.
Secondly, we might need technological upgrades and new methods of payment‚Äîi.e. inline registration without leaving a story. Looking ahead at solutions, we'll present the ideal experience alongside the existing model(s).

## Designing within the User Flow & Consumer Funnel

Looking at the user flow and our consumer funnel it appears that our recurring audience would be the target for this case study. They've already been exposed to the USA Today Network brand and visit our site at least a couple of times a week. By Jakob's UX Law where users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar, we can capitalize on their mental model of a paywall as well as improve upon the experience. Product just launched a new payment page too which will be an added benefit to our experience for the moment as our reader will most likely have to leave our story to sign up if not already. One way we might capitalize on our reader's framing effect bias is by presenting the decision to unlock these features with options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations; e.g. as a loss or as a gain. The framing effect states that people tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented. We might also be able to introduce a loss aversion mechanism where we let readers try out a new feature before investing in it.

## Onto Solutions

First, we'll signal to the reader this story is an enhanced experience. At this stage the reader is just joining us and deciding if they want to continue their investment in the story. We already can provide labeling with stories from the I-Team and other xtensive series. Related information about visual queuing to our audience can be find in Product UX's research of Opinion labeling.
An enhanced experience as any story that includes features which help the reader go deeper.

From here, if a reader is registered, we might signal them to continue to sign up...
For subscribers, we'll add a label to items also reinforcing the added value of the features they're receiving.
For the offering, we'll split the demonstrations into two segments of offering a bundle of features as well as just offering one feature to unlock.
