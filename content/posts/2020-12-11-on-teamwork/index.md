In soccer the most important player—the leader—is in the back. 
Yes, the goalie. 

She commands from the rear because she can see the lay of the field. 
Now, what that means in terms of business and life might seem obvious but let’s dive into what the other players are doing.

The goalie is the one who typically gets blamed at younger ages for “missing” the kick and allowing goals in. But, they possess the ability to command their team in such a way to both protect the net and prevent the ball from even coming near the goal. When the ball is being maneuvered back and forth and passed between players, the goalie should possesses a watchful eye ever vigilant and on their toes should the offense move onto their half of the field.

Another important role of the goalie is the ability to decisiveness when it comes to playing defense. They know when it’s important to give their team a break and when to let the offensive team push forward a bit. But, defense is as much preventative as it is battling back. If you ever watch a professional match you’ll see how the defensive players along with the goalie will swing the ball from one side of the field to the other to try to create a different momentum. Then, when the time is right, the goalie and the whole team move forward together with the ball. Should they be lucky enough to score, you’ll be able to trace game film all the way back to when the goalie first touched the ball.

The defenders, halfbacks, and strikers who get a lot of the glory receive a lot of TV time and actual ball time.

We often tend to feel our work is tough, but we should see our teammates too.

As a teammate, strive for empathy
Put yourself in your teammates' shoes
Understand their perspective
Understand where they are coming from
