## Gannett and elevating storytelling

During my time with Gannett (the USA TODAY Network), I've worked on numerous projects with the Storytelling Studio. Most notably, I worked with the Storytelling Studio (formerly Gannett's Innovation Lab) on redesigning and relaunching longform content with a a few twists. The first being that we wanted to support more storyforms than longform. This includes short-form stories, visually impactful stories, timeline frameworks, quiz tooling, photojournalist tooling, collective lists curation and creation, and varying story archs. So, instead we created a framework that enhcna (in the form of building new features, such as password-protected shared links) and marketing efforts. Additionally, I helped lead the engineering efforts to build the marketing pages for Dropbox Pro.

After the initial launch of the new framework, our team was bent on growth through reciruclation and looking at funnel acquisition methods. We spent months experimenting with marketing efforts, newsletter tactics, and testing to fine the reader experience. We saw a direct and substantial positive impact on subscriptions and engagements through our improvements.

Our small ‚Äúblue sky‚Äù growth team to explores how we might foster increased adoption of things like social sharing, reader commenting, newsletter subscriptions, and more. The most successful project to emerge was the addition of our In-Depth Index. Facilitated through the knowledge gained from user testing and research, we increased awareness of internal kpis, raised the bar for visual production, just as we had hoped, and unlocked possibilities for other sister teams to build richer, more reader-centric experiences.

## The List:
- In-Depth: a storytelling framework to enhance digital experiences
- Collections: 50 States and curated lists
- The Pulse/ Detroit Now: an experimental mobile first news experience
- Explainers: highly impactful visual stories
- Quizzes: weekly news quiz platform
